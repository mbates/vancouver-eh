# Vancouver-eh game nights

In this document I’ll describe how to get setup for a game night. The suite of games that we will play is called JackBox Party Pack. These games are easy for everyone to get into and require very little prior knowledge.

## First let’s get setup.

1. The first step to playing is to install an app called Discord, do not use the web version of Discord, it won't join the game properly. Discord is very similar to slack and is used to communicate with your fellow gamers. The UI looks very similar to slack but there are a few differences we will get into soon. First download the client from here https://discordapp.com/.
2. Once you have discord downloaded open the app, if this is your first time using discord you’ll need to make an account. Make your account and then once you are done you are all ready to join the Vancouver-Eh Gaming server.
3. To join our server all you have to do is click this link https://discord.gg/nB9Vm8. Then you are ready to go.

## Discord basics:

**(Note): Please use headphones or a headset when gaming as no one wants to hear themselves talking (Gamer etiquette)**

In order to actually talk in discord you have to join a voice channel. Voice channels look like the image below, you can tell they are voice channels because they have a little speaker next to them.

To join a voice channel all you have to do is click on it and you’ll automatically join it and be ready to chat. To know if you are chatting when you talk your icon will glow with a ring around it when you are speaking.

To disconnect you can either quit the app, or click the hang up button in the bottom left corner that looks like this.

## Gaming Basics:

To play any jackbox party game it’s pretty simple. You can play just on your laptop, if you want you can use your phone as a controller. Your laptop will be used to watch the main game screen, either your phone or the website http://jackbox.tv will be the "controller".

To view the main game screen, go to discord and find the person streaming (it’ll say live next to their name). Then click on watch stream. Example image below.

Once you are in the stream you will see the game.

## Playing the Game:

Once you are chatting with your buds, and have the stream running, you are ready to play. The next step is very easy. You take out your phone or other internet device, and go to https://jackbox.tv/ and enter the room code and a name and you are ready to play. Every game has these instructions before starting. An example screen looks like this
